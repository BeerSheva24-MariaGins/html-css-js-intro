## Project Description

A simple traffic light simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The state machine controls the light sequence with a 2-second interval for each transition.

### Traffic Light States

1. Red ON
2. Red + Yellow ON
3. Green ON
4. Yellow ON

Then loop repeats.

The lights are switched using CSS class replacements based on the current state defined in the `statesMachine` array.

### File structure

- `index.html`: base HTML structure
- `css/styles.css`: styles for the traffic light and button
- `src/main.js`: JavaScript logic for state transitions
